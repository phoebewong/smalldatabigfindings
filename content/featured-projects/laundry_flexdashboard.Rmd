Summary: I'm tired of waiting for the on-site laundry machines at my apartment buildings and therefore, I scraped one-month data of the real-time machine usage (in Nov 2017) and that gave me a reason to try out flexdashboard.

## Flexdashboard 
Before this project, I have primarily used Shiny to build interactive web applications or interactive visualization. Even though I learned about the existence of flexdashboard, I never had the opportunity to use it at work. The laundry data gave me a great reason to try it out!

Below is the live dashboard (it will take some time to load the first time.)

## Future Development
The work is in continuous development, I would love to try out different interactive visualization libraries (I'm familiar with plotly and would like to try something new). I have also scraped data in June 2018 which I plan to do a seasonal comparison in the future.
