Summary: I built a R Shiny app during the 9-hour hackathon and won the first-place. 

### The Hackathon
I join the hackathon because I want to apply my skills in fields that support women as well as to gain experience working with non-programmers. My team (formed at the hackathon kick-off event) has two therapists, a project manager, a designer and a programmer (myself). 

I really enjoyed the hackathon, because of how diverse the participants were. Around half of the participants are linked to the Health industry, including therapists, doctors, and public health students. Some are developers, most with limited experience in Health (including myself), and some others are a mix of project managers and designers. 

### The problem
The hackathon's theme is on supporting women. After some discussion, our team decided to tackle on an under-discussed topic - Pelvic Floor Dysfunction (PFD). More than one-thrid of U.S. women have a PFD, according to [NIH](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/pelvicfloor/conditioninfo/risk) and we thought that it was important to raise the awareness of PFD as well as providing resources for those who are suffering from the dysfunction.

### The app

I used R Shiny to build an web application that visualizes U.S. national hospital locations (as a proxy of therapist locations).
