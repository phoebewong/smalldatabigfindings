<p>Summary: I worked for <a href="https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/about">EcoHealth Alliance</a> (an international nonprofit with the goal of protecting the health of people, animals and the environment from emerging infectious diseases) for 3 months as a R Shiny developer to build a Shiny dashboard for their <a href="https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/program/ideeal">Infectious Disease Emergence and Economics of Altered Landscapes (IDEEAL) project</a>.</p>
<p>The project aims at building economic models of land-use change and economics of disease emergence that can be used by local and regional decision makers. I implemented an interactive and user-friendly R Shiny web application to help visualize results of the land-use change economic model. I also created interactive and interpretable visualizations for users (the general public) which allows the users to visualize how the result changes with different model inputs.</p>
<p>The application is not yet published and unfortunately not available for the public at the moment.</p>
