Summary: I worked for [EcoHealth Alliance](https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/about) (an international nonprofit with the goal of protecting the health of people, animals and the environment from emerging infectious diseases) for 3 months as a R Shiny developer to build a Shiny dashboard for their [Infectious Disease Emergence and Economics of Altered Landscapes (IDEEAL) project](https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/program/ideeal).

The project aims at building economic models of land-use change and economics of disease emergence that can be used by local and regional decision makers. I implemented an interactive and user-friendly R Shiny web application to help visualize results of the land-use change economic model. I also created interactive and interpretable visualizations for users (the general public) which allows the users to visualize how the result changes with different model inputs.

The application is not yet published and unfortunately not available for the public at the moment.
