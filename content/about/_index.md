I'm Phoebe Wong, a data scientist with a research background and interest in Social Psychology and Marketing. Unlike many other data scientists, I came from a Social Science background (Psychology) and am interested in the intersection of the two fields, which includes the field of Data Science, Human-Computer Interaction, Consumer Psychology and Decision-making.

I am currently a master student in Data Science at Harvard University. Prior to joining Harvard, I worked at Legendary Entertainment/WarnerMedia Applied Analytics where my work focused on consumer psychology and marketing strategy recommendation. Before joining Legendary, I graduated from UC Berkeley in Psychology. My senior thesis focuses on studying the phenomenon of loss aversion in the context of lottery decision making.

#### Why small data?
"Big Data" is a recent buzzword that is used (and often misued) in the world of Data Science. The title of my blog is mostly a joke that goes against the idea. The serious reason that I focus on small data here is because most data posts on this blog will be based on **"small enough"** data that it fits into my laptop memory. 

Don't get me wrong, knowing how to work with big data (e.g.,high-performance computing) is definitely important for a Data Scientist. However, I think a lot of the times, the fundamental skills (statistics, visualizations/communcations and efficient programming) are overlooked. 

Therefore, we will go **small** for now.

If you are interested in learning more about flaws of big data, you should check out this talk on [Statistical paradises and paradoxies in Big Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YLdIDOMEZs) by Professor Xiao-Li Meng, Dean of Graduate School of Arts and Science at Harvard.

#### R-Ladies
I serve as a co-organizer for [R-Ladies Boston](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-boston/). [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) is a worldwide organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community.
